# Technical Submission for R3

#### How to build run the code

In terminal, please navigate to the project directory ("NAC_CherryLim"). Execute 
`gradle build` to compile the code, then `gradle run` to execute it.

If opening the project in an IDE, please run the 'gradle build' task, followed by 'gradle run'.

##### Some remarks
- My solution allows any grid, with length of at least 3, to be verified.
 - My constructor takes in a 2D char array, i.e. `char[][]`.
  - Customisation of the grid can be done in Main class 
- Please ignore the ".idea" folder if the project isn't opened in IntelliJ.
